# react-native-rich-text

Proof of concept for a JavaScript only rich TextInput component for React Native.
The main idea is to render `<Text>` views as children of `<TextInput>`.
It will only support text styling since it's not possible to render images inside `Text` views in React Native.

> [!NOTE]
> Works out of the box with Expo Go.

## Features

- [x] Basic text formatting (*bold*, _italic_, __underline__, ~~strikethrough~~).
- [ ] Rich text format parsing (WIP).
- [ ] Links and mentions.
- [ ] Custom styling.
- [ ] Exposed event handlers (onSubmit, onChange, onBlur, onFocus, etc).
- [ ] Custom methods and event handlers (setText, onStartMention, onStyleChange, etc)

## Known limitations
- Inline images.
