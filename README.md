# react-native-rich-text

Proof of concept for a JavaScript only rich TextInput component for React Native.
The main idea is to render `<Text>` views as children of `<TextInput>`.
It will only support text styles since it's not possible to render images inside Text views in React Native.

## Future plans
- Custom styles support.
- Add support for rich text inline formatting (*, ~, #, etc).

## Known limitations
- Inline images.
